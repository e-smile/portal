With e-smile, we wish to see more open, effective and transparent aid systems supporting sustainable and equitable development and engaging citizens not only as beneficiaries, but as actors of their own development.

Concretely, e-Smile is a series of plug-and-play applications combined together to build agile, open, coherent and contextualized information management and monitoring systems.
